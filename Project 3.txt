Project 3: Linear Regression Model Development and Evaluation
Project Title: Predictive Modeling: Linear Regression for Continuous Target Variable
Project Goal: To develop, train, and rigorously evaluate a Linear Regression model for predicting a continuous target variable, utilizing a benchmark regression dataset. This project aims to demonstrate proficiency in model training, hyperparameter tuning (implicitly, by using a standard model), performance metric calculation, and result visualization.
Objectives:
1. Dataset Acquisition and Preparation:
o Acquire and load a suitable regression dataset (e.g., Boston Housing dataset or a comparable alternative, ensuring ethical data usage if using Boston Housing).
o Perform initial data inspection and necessary basic cleaning to ensure readiness for model training.
2. Data Splitting for Model Validation:
o Split the prepared dataset into distinct training and testing sets, adhering to an 80/20 ratio. This will ensure robust model evaluation on unseen data.
3. Linear Regression Model Training and Evaluation:
o Model Training: Train a Linear Regression model using the designated training dataset.
o Prediction Generation: Generate predictions on the held-out testing dataset using the trained model.
o Performance Metric Calculation: Calculate and report key regression evaluation metrics on the test data:
 Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): A measure of the average magnitude of the errors.
 Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The average of the absolute errors.
 R-squared (R2): The proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
4. Results Visualization:
o Create a professional scatter plot visualizing the relationship between the predicted values and the actual values from the test set. Include a diagonal line (y=x) for reference to visually assess model accuracy.
Tools/Libraries:
• Python 3.x
• Pandas (for data handling)
• NumPy (for numerical operations)
• Scikit-learn (for model training, data splitting, and metrics: LinearRegression, train_test_split, mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error, r2_score)
• Matplotlib / Seaborn (for plotting)
Deliverables:
• A well-documented Python script (.py or .ipynb) containing all steps from data loading to model evaluation and visualization.
• A clear output of the calculated RMSE, MAE, and R2 scores on the test set.
• A high-resolution image file (e.g., .png) of the "Predicted vs. Actual Values" plot.
• Brief interpretation of the model's performance based on the calculated metrics and the visualization.
Success Criteria:
• The selected dataset is loaded and split correctly.
• The Linear Regression model is trained successfully.
• All three required evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, R2) are accurately calculated and presented.
• The "Predicted vs. Actual Values" plot is correctly generated, providing a clear visual representation of model fit.
• The code is clean, readable, and reproducible.
